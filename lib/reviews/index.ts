Not only do they give cash rewards for simple searches and tasks, they also offer cash back when using Google and other basic web browsers. With Octopus Browser, cash back isn't a chore or a hassle but rather an automated process that takes minimal effort. This browser is so user friendly that it takes virtually no time to set up and every day thereafter will be hassle-free cashback accumulating experience!",

      comment: "Octopus Browser is a cashback browser that pays you for surfing the Internet. I've been using it for a few months and I really like it. It's similar to Google Chrome, so it's easy to use and familiar. But the best part is that you earn cashback for every website you visit. The cashback varies depending on the site, but it's usually a few cents. Over time, those add up! I've already earned over $10 in cashback, which is pretty cool.",

      comment: "Octopus Browser is a cashback browser with which you can get money for surfing the Internet. I love it because it gives me cash back for doing something I already do- namely, browsing the internet! Plus, it's really easy to use. You can just search Google like you always do, and if there's a cashback offer available, Octopus will automatically apply it. No need to worry about codes or anything like that. I've already made $30 in cash back from using Octopus, and I know that number will only go up!",
