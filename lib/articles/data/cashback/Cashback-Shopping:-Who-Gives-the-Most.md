# Cashback Shopping: Who Gives the Most?

Cashback shopping is a popular way to save money while you shop online. When you use cashback, you get a percentage of your purchase amount returned to you after completing your purchase. Depending on the retailer, this can be anywhere from 1% to 10% or more. But when it comes to cashback shopping, who gives back the most? Let's explore some of the top retailers that offer great cashback rewards.

**Amazon**. Amazon is one of the biggest names in online retail and they offer some of the best cashback deals around. Depending on the product, you'll typically get between 2-5% back in rewards when shopping at Amazon. They also have a Prime membership which entitles customers to even higher levels of cashback rewards - up to 10%. Plus, Prime members get free shipping and other perks which make it a great deal for online shoppers.

**Walmart**. Walmart is another popular online retailer that offers competitive cashback rates for their customers. For most products, Walmart will give back between 1-3% in cashback rewards but if you're a frequent shopper then you can expect greater rewards as well. Plus, Walmart has recently rolled out their own loyalty program where customers can earn even more rewards based on how much they shop with them each month.

**Target**. Target is another major player in the world of online retail and they offer some great cashback deals too! Customers can expect to get between 1-4% back when shopping at Target depending on what product categories they buy from. They also have special offers throughout the year where customers can earn even higher levels of cashback if they purchase certain items during those times.
