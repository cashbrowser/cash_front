When you make a purchase through one of these partners, you will receive a percentage of your total purchase price as “cashback” in your account. Some services also offer bonus points or other rewards when you shop with their partners

Using a cashback service is simple. All you have to do is find the retailer that offers the highest cashback rate for your purchase, then click through their link on the cashback service's website before making your purchase. This will ensure that the service tracks your purchase so that it can add the cash back into your account after it processes the transaction.
