# How much you can save with different cashback methods

Cashback incentives have been gaining traction in recent years and have become a popular way to save money while shopping. Cashback methods vary, ranging from traditional rewards cards to online cashback programs. With the right setup, you can potentially save hundreds of dollars a year through cashback rewards.

One of the simplest ways to get cashback is through traditional reward cards such as those offered by most major supermarkets and drugstores. These cards are linked directly to your store account and offer discounts on purchases made with that store’s loyalty card. On average, these rewards programs will provide around 5% back in savings for every dollar spent at the store. This can add up quickly over time, especially if you are an avid shopper at one particular store since the more you purchase, the higher your potential savings will be.

Online cashback programs are also widely available and offer even greater potential savings than traditional reward cards. Sites like Rakuten offer generous cashback bonuses when shoppers make purchases through their platform or use their app when making online purchases. Rewards vary based on each individual retailer, but can range from 1-20%, depending on the retailer and how much you spend with them over a given year. Furthermore, some online retailers even offer special bonus offers for using Rakuten with their stores - all adding up to an increase in savings for savvy shoppers!

Another great way to max out your cashback potential is to take advantage of credit card rewards points and miles. Many credit cards now feature rotating categories that allow you to earn additional points or miles on specific types of purchases (such as groceries or gas). Additionally, many credit cards come with sign-up bonuses which can yield significant amounts of bonus points and miles that can then be used towards travel or merchandise purchases - once again leading to substantial savings!

Finally, it is also worth considering loyalty programs when trying to maximize your cashback potential as well as potential benefits offered by loyalty memberships such as free shipping or exclusive access to sales events at certain stores or websites. While these may not necessarily provide a direct monetary benefit (like other methods described here), they still have the potential of leading to greater long-term savings if used strategically in combination with other forms of cashback opportunities mentioned above. 

Overall, there are numerous ways you can save money through cashback incentives if you take the time to explore various options available and set up effective strategies for taking advantage of them all. Whether it’s through reward cards at your local grocery store, online shopping portals like Rakuten, credit card rewards points/miles or loyalty program memberships - each option holds its own unique set of benefits that should be taken into consideration before settling on one particular method for saving money through cashbacks.
