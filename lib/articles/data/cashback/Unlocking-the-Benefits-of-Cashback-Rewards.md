### What is Cashback Rewards?

Cashback rewards are a type of reward offered by credit card companies and banks as an incentive for customers who use their cards for purchases. Typically, when you make a purchase with your cashback credit card, you will receive a percentage of that purchase back as a reward—hence the term “cash back”! This is usually done through points or miles that can be redeemed for merchandise, gift cards, travel credits, and more. The exact amount of the reward varies depending on the issuer and type of card used.

### How Can You Use Your Cashback Rewards?

The most common way to use your cash back rewards is to redeem them for merchandise or gift cards. Many issuers offer online catalogs where you can browse items that can be purchased with your accumulated points or miles. You can also redeem your cash back rewards for travel credits or airline tickets as long as they are available through your specific issuer's program. Additionally, some cash back programs allow you to donate your earned rewards to charities or other causes of your choice.

Knowing how to maximize these benefits is key for getting the most out of any cash back program.
