# Popular Cashback Extensions for Browsers

Cashback extensions are relatively new tools that allow online shoppers to earn cashback on their purchases. These extensions can be installed in any major web browser and are becoming increasingly popular with savvy shoppers looking for ways to save money on their purchases.

Cashback extensions work by tracking your purchases and giving you a percentage of the purchase back in the form of cash. This percentage varies by retailer, but typically ranges from 1-10%. Some retailers offer higher percentages for certain products or during special promotions. By installing a cashback extension, you’ll get notified when a retailer is offering cashback and can earn extra savings without having to search for coupons or deals yourself.

The most popular cashback extension is Rakuten, formerly known as Ebates. Rakuten offers up to 40% cashback from over 2,500 stores as well as exclusive discounts and promo codes. The extension also includes coupon codes, free in-store pickup options and price comparison features so you can find the best deal for any item you’re shopping for. In addition, Rakuten has an extensive referral program so users can earn additional rewards for referring friends to join their program.

Other popular cashback extensions include TopCashBack, BeFrugal and CouponCabin which all offer similar features plus loyalty programs and additional incentives. With these apps, users can link their credit cards or bank accounts to automatically track all qualifying purchases made online or in stores like Walmart, Target or Best Buy and earn rewards with each purchase they make. 

One advantage of using a cashback extension compared to traditional couponing is that it requires less effort on the part of the consumer because all applicable offers will be automatically applied at checkout without needing to search for specific discounts or promo codes. Also, many of these services provide more reliable access than coupon websites which often require users to keep track of expiration dates and other restrictions that come with each offer. 

For those who shop online frequently or like saving money without having to do too much extra work -- installing a free cashback extension is an easy way to start earning extra savings with every purchase you make!
