# Reap the Rewards of WhatsApp Payments with Cashback!

Are you a frequent user of WhatsApp Payments? If so, you’re in luck. Recently, WhatsApp has rolled out an exciting new feature to reward its users with cashback when they use the payments service. Now, customers can enjoy discounts and rewards with every payment they make on WhatsApp. Let’s explore further how this new feature works and how it can benefit your wallet.


### How Does It Work?

The new cashback feature works by allowing customers to receive rewards through their WhatsApp Payments account after each payment is made. The rewards will be based on the amount of money spent, so the more you spend, the more rewards you get! The cashback rewards are accrued over time and can be used for any purchases within the app, including sending money for gifts or services.

### How Can You Get Cashback?

The first step is to set up your WhatsApp Payments account if you haven't already done so. Once your account is active, all purchases made using the app will count as eligible transactions and will earn you cash back rewards. Additionally, there are certain promotions that offer bonus cash back when certain requirements are met, such as making multiple payments over a certain amount or spending a specific amount within a given period of time. These promotions will be advertised directly in the app itself so keep an eye out for them!
