# Unlocking the Benefits of Cashback on Your SBI Credit Cards

A credit card can be a great way to make purchases, pay for expenses, and manage your money. But did you know that having an SBI credit card also offers you incredible cashback benefits? Let’s take a look at exactly what cashback is, how it works with SBI cards, and how you can unlock the most value from this program.

What Is Cashback?

Cashback is a type of reward or incentive program offered by many credit cards in which the cardholder will receive a percentage of their purchase back as “cash” in their account. For example, if you purchase $100 worth of items with your SBI credit card, you may be eligible to receive 5% cashback—in other words, $5 back in your account. It's like getting free money!

How Does Cashback Work With SBI Cards?

The exact amount of cashback that you can earn with your SBI card depends on the type of card you have, as well as any promotions or rewards programs that are currently available. However, generally speaking, SBI offers anywhere from 1% to 10% cashback on eligible purchases made with its cards. You can also earn additional points for certain types of purchases—such as travel-related expenses—which can then be redeemed for even more cash back.

SBI also offers special seasonal promotions where customers can earn higher levels of cashback on certain types of purchases made within a specific time frame. For example, right now there is an offer where customers who use their SBI credit cards at select gas stations will earn 20% cashback on their fuel costs. It pays to stay up-to-date on these kinds of promotions so that you can take advantage of them when they become available.
