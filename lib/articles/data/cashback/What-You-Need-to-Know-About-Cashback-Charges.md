# What You Need to Know About Cashback Charges

Many people are familiar with the concept of cashback and have likely heard about offers from credit cards that offer a small percentage back on purchases made. But what does it really mean to receive “cashback”? How is it charged, and what are the details you need to know? Let’s take a look at the basics of cashback so that you can make an informed decision when it comes to your credit card.

### What Is Cashback?

Cashback is extra money given back to you after making a purchase on certain items or services. It is usually offered as an incentive by banks or credit card companies, and these rewards may be in the form of points, miles, or money back. Typically, cashback programs will offer 1-3% of your purchase back in rewards. Banks also offer sign-up bonuses for new customers in which they can earn up to 10% cashback on their first purchases.

### How Is Cashback Charged?

Cashback rewards are typically charged as a percentage of the total amount spent on eligible purchases. For example, if you spend $100 at a store that offers a 2% cashback rate, then you would receive $2 back at the end of the month or quarter (depending on when the issuer processes their payments). Most issuers have specific rules regarding how often they process payments for cashbacks, so make sure to read through those before signing up for any type of reward program.

### What Are The Details Of A Cashback Program?

When signing up for any type of rewards program, it’s important to understand all the details associated with it. This includes reading through all the fine print associated with your issuer’s rewards program such as expiration dates, limits on spending amounts per quarter/year etc. Additionally, familiarizing yourself with which stores and merchants qualify for cashbacks is also important as this could vary depending on where you shop and what kind of products/services you buy from them.
